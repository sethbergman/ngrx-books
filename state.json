The book helps you to continue to grow and clearly comes from people who have been there.” </p> —<b>Kent Beck</b>, author of <i>Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change </i> <p>“I found this book to be a great mix of solid advice and wonderful analogies!” </p> —<b>Martin Fowler</b>, author of <i>Refactoring</i> and <i>UML Distilled </i> <p>“I would buy a copy, read it twice, then tell all my colleagues to run out and grab a copy. This is a book I would never loan because I would worry about it being lost.” </p> —<b>Kevin Ruland</b>, Management Science, MSG-Logistics <p>“The wisdom and practical experience of the authors is obvious. The topics presented are relevant and useful.... By far its greatest strength for me has been the outstanding analogies—tracer bullets, broken windows, and the fabulous helicopter-based explanation of the need for orthogonality, especially in a crisis situation. I have little doubt that this book will eventually become an excellent source of useful information for journeymen programmers and expert mentors alike.” </p> —<b>John Lakos</b>, author of <i>Large-Scale C++ Software Design</i> <p>“This is the sort of book I will buy a dozen copies of when it comes out so I can give it to my clients.” </p> —<b>Eric Vought</b>, Software Engineer <p>“Most modern books on software development fail to cover the basics of what makes a great software developer, instead spending their time on syntax or technology where in reality the greatest leverage possible for any software team is in having talented developers who really know their craft well. An excellent book.” </p> —<b>Pete McBreen</b>, Independent Consultant <p>“Since reading this book, I have implemented many of the practical suggestions and tips it contains. Across the board, they have saved my company time and money while helping me get my job done quicker!

It covers topics ranging from personal responsibility and career development to architectural techniques for keeping your code flexible and easy to adapt and reuse. Read this book, and you'll learn how to </p> <ul> <li>Fight software rot; <li>Avoid the trap of duplicating knowledge; <li>Write flexible, dynamic, and adaptable code; <li>Avoid programming by coincidence; <li>Bullet-proof your code with contracts, assertions, and exceptions; <li>Capture real requirements; <li>Test ruthlessly and effectively; <li>Delight your users; <li>Build teams of pragmatic programmers; and <li>Make your developments more precise with automation. </li> </ul> <p>Written as a series of self-contained sections and filled with entertaining anecdotes, thoughtful examples, and interesting analogies, <b> <i>The Pragmatic Programmer</i> </b> illustrates the best practices and major pitfalls of many different aspects of software development. Whether you're a new coder, an experienced programmer, or a manager responsible for software projects, use these lessons daily, and you'll quickly see improvements in personal productivity, accuracy, and job satisfaction.

more fine-grained in the past 10 years, shifting from code-heavy monolithic applications to smaller, self-contained microservices. But developing these systems brings its own set of headaches. With lots of examples and practical advice, this book takes a holistic view of the topics that system architects and administrators must consider when building, managing, and evolving microservice architectures. Microservice technologies are moving quickly.

It makes asynchronous programming cleaner, intuitive, and robust. Discover how to use the RxJS library to write programs in a simpler way, unifying asynchronous mechanisms such as callbacks and promises into a single, powerful construct. Learn to think about your programs as streams of data that you can transform by expressing <i>what</i> should happen, instead of having to painstakingly program <i>how</i> it should happen. You'll be able to handle real-world concurrency and write complex flows of events in your applications with ease.<br><br>Create highly concurrent applications while writing simpler code using the Reactive Extensions for JavaScript (RxJS), a set of libraries for event composition. Programming real-world applications in JavaScript involves lots of asynchronous events--you might end up spending more time coordinating asynchronous code in your program than writing its actual functionality. This book introduces concepts and tools from reactive programming that will help you write cleaner and more robust asynchronous programs.<br><br>Find out about Observable sequences, a unifying data type to write highly concurrent code. Discover Schedulers and change the concept of time in your applications, making asynchronous testing sane again.

Basic knowledge of React.JS is necessary, however you do not need detailed knowledge of the other stack components such as Node.JS, Express, MongoDB, or Falcor.What You Will Learn* See how to build a full-stack app that is scalable and designed for the demands of modern users* Create a powerful JWT-based authentication full-stack \"starter-kit\"* Make your app extremely stable and resilient with Redux and its immutable single state tree* Explore the new possibilities given by Falcor, the middleware built by Netflix* Find out how Redux works alongside ReactJS - and how it makes building an isomorphic app easier* Deploy and maintain your apps successfully using Docker and AWSIn DetailFull-stack web development is being redefined by the impact of ReactJS. If MEAN demonstrated just how effective combining JavaScript frameworks and tools could be for the modern web developer, by replacing Angular with React, developers have an easier way to build isomorphic web applications where code can run on both the client and server.This book will get you up to speed with one of the latest strategies to meet the demands of today's dynamic and data-intensive web. Combining detailed insights and guidance with practical and actionable information that will ensure you can build a complete isomorphic web app, it's an essential resource for the forward-thinking developer.You'll learn how to create a reliable and powerful back-end platform with Node.js and Express, as well as exploring how to use MongoDB as the primary database. You'll see how its flexibility is a core part of any full-stack developer's workflow, as well as learning how to use Mongoose alongside it to make data storage safer and more reliable.You'll also get to grips with Redux, and discover how it perfectly complements React to help you to create consistent and stable applications, providing a single immutable store for your entire application, which means that achieving the level of dynamism you want is easier.This book is about more than just dressing up past trends in a new name. It's about the future of development, and about full-stack development with a cutting edge. With insights and guidance on Falcor, the impressive middleware that powers the Netflix UI, the full-stack puzzle will almost be complete. But we'll take you further, beyond development and into deployment, as you learn how to get your application out there using AWS and Docker, which gives you full control over how you manage and maintain your app once it's being used.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1786461765"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781786461766"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":388,"printType":"BOOK","maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y1CPDAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y1CPDAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y1CPDAEACAAJ&dq=react+redux+angular&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y1CPDAEACAAJ&dq=react+redux+angular&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Mastering_Full_Stack_React_Web_Developme.html?hl=&id=y1CPDAEACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=y1CPDAEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Learn how to create dynamic full-stack applications with ReactJS and other leading JavaScript tools - smarter web development starts hereAbout This Book* Harness the impressive power of ReactJS and rethink full-stack web development* Build ..."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"z4PxvQAACAAJ","etag":"B8+cye9Nr+w","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/z4PxvQAACAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Building Progressive Web Apps: Bringing the Power of Native to the Browser","authors":["Ater"],"publisher":"O'Reilly Media","publishedDate":"2017-02-25","description":"If you re working on the Web in 2016, you ve probably heard something about Progressive Web Apps.

It makes asynchronous programming cleaner, intuitive, and robust. Discover how to use the RxJS library to write programs in a simpler way, unifying asynchronous mechanisms such as callbacks and promises into a single, powerful construct. Learn to think about your programs as streams of data that you can transform by expressing <i>what</i> should happen, instead of having to painstakingly program <i>how</i> it should happen. You'll be able to handle real-world concurrency and write complex flows of events in your applications with ease.<br><br>Create highly concurrent applications while writing simpler code using the Reactive Extensions for JavaScript (RxJS), a set of libraries for event composition. Programming real-world applications in JavaScript involves lots of asynchronous events--you might end up spending more time coordinating asynchronous code in your program than writing its actual functionality. This book introduces concepts and tools from reactive programming that will help you write cleaner and more robust asynchronous programs.<br><br>Find out about Observable sequences, a unifying data type to write highly concurrent code. Discover Schedulers and change the concept of time in your applications, making asynchronous testing sane again. Along the way you'll see real-world examples for the browser and Node.js, including a real-time earthquake visualization in 20 lines of code and a frantic shoot-'em-up space videogame. You'll also use Cycle.js - a modern, fully reactive web framework - to make a whole new breed of web applications.<br><br>By the end of the book, you'll know how to apply reactive programming to solve complex problems, build efficient programs with reactive user interfaces, and write your code more declaratively.<br><br><b>What You Need: </b><br><br>A modern web browser, Node.JS installed in your computer, and the RxJS JavaScript library.</p>","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1680501291"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781680501292"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":140,"printedPageCount":140,"dimensions":{"height":"23.30 cm","width":"19.20 cm","thickness":"0.90 cm"},"printType":"BOOK","maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tc33sgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&imgtk=AFLRE72i7ABJaHdSW7cujAPQ2ckeSj0_HUAaN0KjDNVgMJhccHFawwsjEAeiC8hKjkDz--oD0VIz7cnPhJWYdoHWNN58lVa-oSMHjbJEsU8IFtzhydwwGf2aUeKgvKAYkg8MTz0Fhib0&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tc33sgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE72mrv_T1E-xnAr_hmC3nxJ3SRP37RsXIv0jY0W0_WkpHN9oipKZ8UMUosHDflJlk0iqiQJ49B_xQEcLQPgv3TqW814IMozHCDv4BBi7qfVAKUktC7Piy0XUPu508VR2HsxHeBC3&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tc33sgEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tc33sgEACAAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://market.android.com/details?id=book-tc33sgEACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=tc33sgEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}},"y1CPDAEACAAJ":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"y1CPDAEACAAJ","etag":"wBFRXXlUxT0","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/y1CPDAEACAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Mastering Full Stack React Web Development","authors":["Tomasz Dyl","Kamil Przeorski","Maciej Czarnecki"],"publishedDate":"2016-08-31","description":"Learn how to create dynamic full-stack applications with ReactJS and other leading JavaScript tools - smarter web development starts hereAbout This Book* Harness the impressive power of ReactJS and rethink full-stack web development* Build dynamic web applications using the tools created by the innovators driving the tech industry* Created to make you a smarter, more confident web developerWho This Book Is ForThis book is for JavaScript developers who want to create highly scalable, enterprise-grade apps. Basic knowledge of React.JS is necessary, however you do not need detailed knowledge of the other stack components such as Node.JS, Express, MongoDB, or Falcor.What You Will Learn* See how to build a full-stack app that is scalable and designed for the demands of modern users* Create a powerful JWT-based authentication full-stack \"starter-kit\"* Make your app extremely stable and resilient with Redux and its immutable single state tree* Explore the new possibilities given by Falcor, the middleware built by Netflix* Find out how Redux works alongside ReactJS - and how it makes building an isomorphic app easier* Deploy and maintain your apps successfully using Docker and AWSIn DetailFull-stack web development is being redefined by the impact of ReactJS. If MEAN demonstrated just how effective combining JavaScript frameworks and tools could be for the modern web developer, by replacing Angular with React, developers have an easier way to build isomorphic web applications where code can run on both the client and server.This book will get you up to speed with one of the latest strategies to meet the demands of today's dynamic and data-intensive web. Combining detailed insights and guidance with practical and actionable information that will ensure you can build a complete isomorphic web app, it's an essential resource for the forward-thinking developer.You'll learn how to create a reliable and powerful back-end platform with Node.js and Express, as well as exploring how to use MongoDB as the primary database. You'll see how its flexibility is a core part of any full-stack developer's workflow, as well as learning how to use Mongoose alongside it to make data storage safer and more reliable.You'll also get to grips with Redux, and discover how it perfectly complements React to help you to create consistent and stable applications, providing a single immutable store for your entire application, which means that achieving the level of dynamism you want is easier.This book is about more than just dressing up past trends in a new name. It's about the future of development, and about full-stack development with a cutting edge. With insights and guidance on Falcor, the impressive middleware that powers the Netflix UI, the full-stack puzzle will almost be complete. But we'll take you further, beyond development and into deployment, as you learn how to get your application out there using AWS and Docker, which gives you full control over how you manage and maintain your app once it's being used.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1786461765"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781786461766"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":388,"printType":"BOOK","maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y1CPDAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y1CPDAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y1CPDAEACAAJ&dq=react+redux+angular&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y1CPDAEACAAJ&dq=react+redux+angular&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.com/books/about/Mastering_Full_Stack_React_Web_Developme.html?hl=&id=y1CPDAEACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=y1CPDAEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Learn how to create dynamic full-stack applications with ReactJS and other leading JavaScript tools - smarter web development starts hereAbout This Book* Harness the impressive power of ReactJS and rethink full-stack web development* Build ..."}},"z4PxvQAACAAJ":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"z4PxvQAACAAJ","etag":"B8+cye9Nr+w","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/z4PxvQAACAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Building Progressive Web Apps: Bringing the Power of Native to the Browser","authors":["Ater"],"publisher":"O'Reilly Media","publishedDate":"2017-02-25","description":"If you re working on the Web in 2016, you ve probably heard something about Progressive Web Apps.
